# Geo Fence Twitter Data

This project was made to try to find 'TorontoJane' - an ISIL sympathizer whose geo-located tweets showed her moving from Toronto to Syria.

Her real Twitter screen_name was:

    LamaAlshammry

We used the same approach to identify other Twitter users whose geo-located data shows them having travelled to Syria. That movement plus the context of their Twitter history may indicate an Isil sympathizer who has travelled to join the movement.
